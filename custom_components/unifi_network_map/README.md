# UniFi Network Map (HA Integration Stub)

This is a minimal HA integration skeleton for future extraction.

## TODO
- Add options flow for client/port inclusion and SVG settings.
- Expose cached assets or endpoints for the Lovelace card.
- Add diagnostics and a basic health check endpoint.
- Decide on storage strategy for SVG/JSON caching.

## Notes
- Rendering uses `unifi_topology` for device/client fetch + SVG output.
