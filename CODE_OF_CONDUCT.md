Our pledge: We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,

appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our standards: Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment
include using welcoming language, being respectful of differing viewpoints,
gracefully accepting constructive criticism, and focusing on what is best for
the community. Examples of unacceptable behavior include harassment, trolling,
insults, and other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate.

clarifying standards and taking appropriate and fair corrective action.

Scope: This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in
community spaces when an individual represents the project or its community.

Enforcement: Report incidents to the maintainers via GitHub issues or private
contact as appropriate. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated.
